# Library System: Final Project for Software Engineering I (MATA62) - UFBA 2024.1

**Authors**: Igor Borja and Caio Mello

This object-oriented software was developed to apply the SOLID principles and design patterns taught in the Software Engineering I course.

Some of the design patterns applied in this project include: 
- Strategy
- Factory
- State
- Singleton
- Observer
- Command

The library system manages and maintains the catalog of books available in an academic library. It allows three types of users (undergraduate students, graduate students, and professors) to borrow, return, and reserve available books.

### How to Run

To execute the program, run `python3 main.py` in the root directory of the repository, which will launch the command-line interface for the library system. It is recommended to use Python version 3.10 or higher to run this program.
